After installing, load the package with library(mvtnorm). Then dmvnorm can be used for calculating the joint PDF, and rmvnorm can be used for generating random vectors. For example, suppose that we want to generate 1000 independent Bivariate Normal pairs (Z, W), with correlation ρ = 0.7 and N (0, 1) marginals. To do this, we can enter the following:"
