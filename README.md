# IntroductionToProbabilityPy

Python equivalent to the R code sections in Blitzstein and Hwang's [Introduction To Probability, 1st Edition](https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-Probability/Blitzstein-Hwang/p/book/9781466575578)

## Requirements

To run these Jupyter notebooks, the following software is required:

* [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/) or greater
* [Numpy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)
* [SciPy](https://scipy.org/install.html)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 


To run the interactive game for the Monty Hall problem in Chapter 2, you will also need the following package:
* [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

The [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) comes highly recommended, and it includes Python, the Spyder integrated development environment, and a whole universe of Python packages for mathematics and engineering, including Numpy, SciPy, and Jupyter. 

## Executing these notebooks locally
After installing Python and Jupyter, navigate to this project's home directory where these notebooks are saved, open up a command window or shell interface, and type the following command:

     jupyter notebook


Your default browser should open up to show the Notebook Dashboard at `http://localhost:8888`.
