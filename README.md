# IntroductionToProbabilityPy

Python equivalent to the R code sections in Blitzstein and Hwang's [Introduction To Probability, 1st Edition](https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-Probability/Blitzstein-Hwang/p/book/9781466575578)

## Requirements

To run these Jupyter notebooks, the following software is required:

* [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/) or greater
* [Numpy 1.15](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html) or greater (includes SciPy)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 

The [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) includes Python, the Spyder integrated development environment, and a whole universe of Python packages for mathematics and engineering, including Numpy, SciPY, and Jupyter.
