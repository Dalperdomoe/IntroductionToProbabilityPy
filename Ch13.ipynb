    "In Chapter 5, we discussed how to simulate a specified number of arrivals from a one-dimensional Poisson process by using the fact that the interarrival times are i.i.d. Exponentials. In this chapter, Story 13.2.3 tells us how to simulate a Poisson process within a specified interval $(0, \\left.L\\right]$. We first generate the number of arrivals $N(L)$, which is distributed $Pois(\\lambda \\, L)$. Conditional on $N(L) = n$, the arrival times are distributed as the order statistics of n i.i.d. $Unif(0, L)$ r.v.s. The following code simulates arrivals from a Poisson process with rate 10 in the interval $(0, \\left. 5\\right]$:"

Finally, the arrivals for which the coin landed Heads are labeled as type-1; the rest are labeled as type-2. The resulting vectors of arrival times $t_1$ and $t_2$ are realizations of independent Poisson processes, by Theorem 13.2.13. To perform this in R with $p = 0.3$, we can type"
